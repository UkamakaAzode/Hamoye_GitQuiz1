Git is a version control system that allows developers to track a project and actively contribute without interfering in each other’s work. In this project, I get to practice what I have learnt so far concerning Git.

Activity 
- Create a  folder and name it whatever you want.
- Run the “Git init” command to initialize the folder as a git repository.
- Make changes to the folder; you can add whatever file you want.
- Stage the changes using “git add” command.
- Commit the changes with git commit.
- Create a remote repository.
- Link the local repository and remote repository.
